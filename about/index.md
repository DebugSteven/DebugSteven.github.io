## About Me

My name is J & I'm a Rust Developer! I’ve worked as a professional Rust developer & worked on open source projects in Rust at the Recurse Center. Besides writing code, I love organizing community. Currently I co-organize the [Boulder/Denver Rust Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Boulder-Denver/).

Previously, I organized a [Haskell Book](haskellbook.com) Club in Denver & online while self studying Haskell themselves. I facilitated discussions to help programmers of all experience levels learn Haskell. I completed the entire book in May 2018 with the group & did another iteration in the Fall of 2018. I got completed my Bachelor’s in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Denver in May 2017.

## Frequently Asked Questions

_Pronouns?_
They/Them/Their

Here is a useful guide to use these pronouns if you are new to them: [pronoun.is/they](https://pronoun.is/they/.../themselves)

_Is it just "J"?_ 

I go by J because it is gender neutral. It is the first letter of my birth name and I wanted to keep it close to that. That's what I preferred to be called.

_Why is your username DebugSteven?_

If I had been assigned male at birth I would've been named Steven. I really liked the name and wanted to incorporate it into my life. I've joked that all I do is fix bugs or you know, debug, and DebugSteven rolled off the tongue.
