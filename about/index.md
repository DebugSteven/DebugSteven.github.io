## About Me

My name is J! I'm a nonbinary coder who uses they/them/their pronouns. I started my first full time tech job as a Rust developer in May 2018. I finished my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Denver in May 2017. 

For the last year, I'd been self studying Haskell by working through the [Haskell Book](haskellbook.com) and completed the entire book at the end of May 2018. I started Denver's first Haskell Book Club and worked through the book with many other developers interested in learning Haskell. 

I'm always interested in learning more about programming and talking with others about programming. You'll frequently find me at [DenverFP meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DenverFP/) or the [Rust Boulder/Denver meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Rust-Boulder-Denver/). If you want to get in touch send me an email at DebugSteven@gmail.com or find me on Twitter [@DebugSteven](https://twitter.com/DebugSteven)

## Frequently Asked Questions
_Is it just "J"?_ 

_Why is your username DebugSteven?_

Strange names, I know! I go by J because it is gender neutral. It is the first letter of my birth name and I wanted to keep it close to that. 

If I had been assigned male at birth I would've been named Steven. I really liked the name and wanted to incorporate it into my life. I joke that all I do is fix bugs or you know, debug, and Debug Steven rolled off the tongue.

## Work

I'm not currently looking for new opportunities right now (updated 6/30/18), but if you're interested to see what I've done so far you can [view my resume here](https://github.com/DebugSteven/Resume/blob/master/DebugSteven_Resume.pdf).
