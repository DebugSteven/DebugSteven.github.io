<center><a href="http://DebugSteven.github.io/"><b>Misadventures of a New Dev</b></a> is a blog to document what I've learned as a beginner developer and potentially help others.</center>

## About Me
I'm J! I'm a quirky nonbinary coder kid with they/them/their pronouns. I finished my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Denver in May 2017 and I'm trying to find my niche in the coding world. I have a budding interest in functional programming. 

I spent one year at Vantiv working as a Software Engineer Intern. I finished a freelance progressive programming contract gig (that I'm going to write about soon) and I'm looking for a full time job now.

## Frequently Asked Questions
_Is it just "J"?_ 
_Why is your username DebugSteven?_

Strange names, I know! I go by J because it is gender neutral. It is the first letter of my birth name and I wanted to keep it close to that. 

If I had been assigned male at birth I would've named me Steven. I really liked the name and wanted to incorporate it into my life. I joke that all I do is fix bugs or you know, debug, and Debug Steven rolled off the tongue.

## What's Next?
* Blog posts
* Haskell
* At least one gross post about WordPress (it will be great)

## Work

You're a tech recuiter and you think I'd be a good fit?
I'm flattered!
