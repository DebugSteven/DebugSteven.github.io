<center><a href="http://DebugSteven.github.io/"><b>Misadventures of a Baby Dev</b></a> is a blog to document what I've learned as a beginner developer and potentially help others.</center>

## About Me
<p> I'm J! I'm a quirky nonbinary coder kid with they/them/their pronouns. I'm wrapping up my Bachelor's in Computer Science from the University of Colorado at Denver and I'm trying to find my niche in the coding world. I have a budding interest in functional programming. 
</p>
<p> I spent one year at Vantiv working as a Software Engineer Intern. I'm currently finishing a progressive programming contract gig (that I'm hoping to write about soon) and looking for a full time job to start in June.
</p>

## What's Next?
* Blog posts
* Haskell???
* At least one gross post about WordPress (it will be great)

## Work

You're a tech recuiter and you think I'd be a good fit?
I'm flattered!
