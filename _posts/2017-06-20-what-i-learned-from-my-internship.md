I learned a lot from my internship at Vantiv. I was the first one hired onto a team in Denver to help fix the broken ForgeRock platform. My supervisor dropped a 350 page manual on my desk and told me to start reading before my mentor was hired. I knew it would be challenging, but I was up to learning something new and doing my best to fix problems. 
 
I received formal ForgeRock training and learned all about Access and Identity Management. I spent most of my time installing, upgrading, integrating components using Jenkins, and deploying the OpenAM software in all environments using Tomcat and WebSphere. I learned how to use Splunk to look at the logs and try to decipher the cryptic error messages.  
 
My first assignment was to make a virtual environment for everyone to test out the ForgeRock software. I setup an Ubuntu VirtualBox environment and then installed all the supporting software needed to run OpenAM and OpenDJ. I remember struggling to get Apache up and running, not seeing the test page. Googling didn’t yield any answers for my more complicated ForgeRock related questions, really. I was sent to the documentation for OpenAM and OpenDJ that didn’t contain the information to solve my problem. The answers I found from the internet and my team were “just fiddle with it some more, you’ll get it.” I always did… eventually.
 
It has been over a year now since I started that project. It was the first time I understood feature creep. The original purpose was to create a sandbox for everyone to mess around with the software ourselves. Other teams were frustrated when ForgeRock would break the DEV and TEST environments. I proposed this solution so that the offshore team would stop calling my managers about the broken TEST environment at 3am. By the time I finished the sandbox environment it wasn’t needed anymore for the original purpose. I continued to add features and it was useful as an environment to train new team members.
 
I then moved on to trying to install a web browser onto our DEV environment to try to have a GUI for some tests. Another team member found that using Selenium would be the best way to go after seeing my beautiful, but meaningless cloudy rainbow desktop that resulted from me running the gnome desktop package I installed onto the CentOS server. Firefox, nor any other application shortcut icons appeared on the lovely looking GUI desktop. Using a headless browser wasn’t the way my team wanted to go because they wanted to view the pages themselves for testing purposes.
 
By this point, I finally felt like I knew what was going on. I had been with the company for about 6 months. I was completing projects without the constant help of my mentor. I would finish support tickets and close them out without having anyone double check my work. I was even interacting directly with clients and providing single sign-on services. I was getting as much work done as any other associate engineer and I was proud to be contributing to the success of my team. 
 
It takes awhile to get used to a company and understand your other teammates’ work. We had another person on the team who worked remote in Ohio. A nice, brilliant guy, but I had a hard time understanding what he was doing. He explained his work with ridiculous, hilarious analogies, a habit everyone picked up from my manager. He was the subject matter expert (SME) and the only reason that everything wasn’t falling apart more than it already was. I remember my manager saying, “you guys are a taco truck. William makes a strange taco that everyone enjoys. Don’t worry about how he makes it. Just keep the truck running and keep making the other types of tacos that people want.” It would’ve taken years of shadowing to understand the company’s architecture and software the way William did.
 
This was my first job in software. I learned how to do Agile, learned more about linux, databases, version control, integration, and the ability to work and get along with others. One day I want to be the SME on a team. The only way I’ll get there is by being passionate about my work, understanding the my teammates’ work, and getting answers to my questions.
